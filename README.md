# web3-NFT-Certificate-dApp
## Introduction
### Bussiness Need
- The client: 10 Academy. Their current system distributes certificates to trainees as simple PDF files, without the ability to verify their authenticity nor can 10 Academy undertake smart actions with the trainees/their contracts.
- The challenge: to establish a system to ensure that certificates are available to all trainees in a secure way, and (if possible) that certificate holders can benefit from smart contract actions now and in the future. 
- Approach: Generate certificates as distributed Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The project will focus on building end-to-end Web3 dapps on the Blockchain that will help 10 Academy generate and distribute NFTs as certificates that will represent the successful completion of a weekly challenge to trainees, and allow trainees with NFTs to interact with a smart contract to perform pre-defined actions. 
- Blockchain: 10 Academy has partnered with Algorand to use the Algorand Blockchain as the foundational element of the NFT.
